MULTI-AGENT: An experiment of multiple AI working cooperatively

The LLM model has proven to have impressive reasoning ability, but it falls short when it comes to solving complex problems. One of its major limitations is its dependency on the quality of the prompt to elicit good results. This means that if the prompt is poorly phrased or vague, the output will be suboptimal.

To address this limitation, an experiment was conducted where multiple AI agents worked together in a cooperative manner. Each agent was given a unique identity and perception of the task at hand. The agents were able to communicate with each other and cooperate to solve the problem.
